{"name":"Plately","tagline":"A simple starting template for front-end web development projects.","body":"# Plately - v 2.0.0\r\n\r\nPlately is a simple starting template I use for front-end web development projects. It's set up to quickly let developers start creating with Jade, Sass, jQuery, and any other dependencies they need to add.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nThis project has a few basic global dependencies to make it.\r\n- Node.js\r\n- Gulp.js, a node task runner for automating common tasks\r\n- NPM (node package manager)\r\n- Bower\r\n- Basic understanding of Jade, Sass, jQuery, etc.\r\n\r\n## Folder Structure\r\n\r\n#### Folders that are already there:\r\n- Jade: Where all the Jade files are stored, which are converted into HTML for the project.\r\n- Img: This is in the Jade folder, and is where all your images go.\r\n- JS: Where your jQuery and Javacript files go, which is the interactivity and logic for the project. Structured to better organize the different files.\r\n- Sass: Where all the Sass files go, separated by a folder structure for better organization.\r\n\r\n#### Folders that are created:\r\n> These are created with the commands in the \"How to Set Up\" section below.\r\n\r\n- Build: The folder that ultimately contains all your final project files - HTML, CSS, Javascript, images, the whole thing.\r\n- Components: All the external dependencies for the project, such as libraries and frameworks. Can be installed and managed with Bower.\r\n- node_modules: All the npm dependencies that put the project together. Take a long time to install but are vital to creating anything at all with Plately.\r\n\r\n## NPM Dependencies\r\n- express: A web application framework that currently just puts the site on localhost:3000 while gulp is running.\r\n- gulp: Basic Gulp module for running the workflow.\r\n- gulp-autoprefixer: Automatically adds browser prefixes to certain CSS styles to ensure cross-compatibility.\r\n- gulp-concat: For merging different JS files together from the JS folder into a single one for the Assets folder.\r\n- gulp-imagemin: For optimizing images in the images placed in the Jade/Img folder and sent to Build.\r\n- gulp-include: for combining and minifying JS files.\r\n- gulp-jade: For converting Jade files to HTML.\r\n- gulp-livereload: For using the Chrome LiveReload extension so pages refresh automatically with changes.\r\n- gulp-notify: Notifying of completed processes or errors.\r\n- gulp-plumber: So any mistakes send a message without halting the workflow.\r\n- gulp-rename: Renaming any files before sending them to the Build folder.\r\n- gulp-sass: For converting Sass to CSS.\r\n- gulp-sourcemaps: Adding sourcemaps to CSS and JS files to speed up debugging.\r\n- gulp-uglify: For compressing JS files.\r\n- gulp-uncss: Removes any CSS element selectors that aren't being used in the Build folder.\r\n\r\n## Bower Dependencies\r\n- [Bourbon]: A lightweight library of Sass mixins for extra functionality.\r\n- [Susy]: A flexible grid tool for responsive layouts\r\n- [jQuery]: A Javascript library that makes writing it and using it a couple hundred times easier.\r\n\r\n## How to Set Up\r\nThere are several commands to get all the needed dependencies installed and ready to view.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n- This install all the node dependencies in the newly created node_modules folder.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbower install\r\n```\r\n- This creates the \"components\" folder and installs all the components controlled with Bower.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp\r\n```\r\n- This is the basic command that constructs the Build folder. It turns the Jade into HTML, the Sass into CSS, optimizes the images, and puts together all the Javascript and jQuery files. This also runs in the background and updates the Build folder any time there's a saved change to any of these files.\r\n- While this is running, you can also view the project on a browser on localhost:3000.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Gulp Commands\r\n\r\n> These are other gulp commands to run from the terminal for building the project. Most of them are the individual commands run as part of the default \"gulp\" command, in case you don't need to run all at once.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp scripts\r\n```\r\n- This only merges and minifies your JS files.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp sass\r\n```\r\n- This only processes and converts your Sass files.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp uncss\r\n```\r\n- This runs through all your Build's CSS, compares it to your HTML, and removes any CSS that's not being used.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp images\r\n```\r\n- This goes through all the images in the Img folder, optimizes them to reduce size, and sends them to the build folder.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp jade\r\n```\r\n- This converts all your Jade files to HTML and sends them to the build folder.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp prod\r\n```\r\n- This is for when your project is ready to be launched. It updates your Sass and JS documentation and optimizes your CSS through minifying it, removing sourcemaps, and adding vendor prefixes. It also runs UnCSS to remove unused CSS, which will need to be removed for dynamic sites such as one-page apps.\r\n\r\n## Special Thanks to\r\n[Thoughtbot] for their wonderful open source tools for front end development. Especially for [Bitters], which was the starting point for much of this project's initial CSS scaling styles and variables. I did play with it and add some extra functions, but much of the original Sass is there.\r\n\r\n[Bourbon]:http://bourbon.io/\r\n[Susy]:http://susy.oddbird.net/\r\n[Bitters]:http://bitters.bourbon.io/\r\n[jQuery]:https://jquery.com/\r\n[Thoughtbot]:https://github.com/thoughtbot","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
